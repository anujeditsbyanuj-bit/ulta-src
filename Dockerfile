# yt-dlp PO-token provider (Akbots/ytdl.py's YouTube "web" client is the
# only one with the full 1080p/720p/480p/360p quality ladder, but it needs
# a valid PO token or YouTube silently caps/drops most of those formats).
# requirements.txt only pip-installs the *plugin* side (the Python glue
# that talks to a provider) — the actual token generator is a separate
# Node.js HTTP server that has to be built and running alongside the bot,
# which is what this block sets up. Pinned to a known-working release tag
# instead of the moving default branch.

# JDownloader (/jd) — baked in at build time so the bot doesn't need to

# boot (Akbots/jdownloader_core.py handles that — can take a few minutes
# the very first time, cached after). No-ops harmlessly if JD_EMAIL/JD_PASS
# aren't set in config — /jd just stays disabled.

# Starts the bgutil PO-token HTTP server in the background (default port
# 4416 — same default the yt-dlp plugin looks for, no extra config on the

# reachable — check the container logs after boot for an explicit
# "[bgutil-pot] OK" or "[bgutil-pot] WARNING" line instead of guessing.
# If the token server fails to start for any reason, the bot still runs —
# it just falls back to tv_embedded/android's lower-res formats for
# YouTube, same as before this was added.
